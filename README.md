# UserHub
Basic CRUD application developed with Node + Express, designed to create, read, update, and delete users through a REST API. Uses Express.js to handle routes and HTTP requests, returning results in JSON.

You can explore and test the API directly using the Swagger UI.

To try it out:
- Go to [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)
- Browse through the available endpoints
- Click on any endpoint to see its details
- Press **"Try it out"** to send test requests and view live responses

This interface is especially useful for developers and testers to understand how the API works and experiment with it interactively.
