# UserHub
Basic CRUD application developed with Node + Express, designed to create, read, update, and delete users through a REST API. Uses Express.js to handle routes and HTTP requests, returning results in JSON.

---

Use the Swagger UI to explore, test, and interact with the API directly:
- Go to [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)
- Browse through the available endpoints
- Click on any endpoint to see its details
- Press **"Try it out"** to send test requests and view live responses

This interface is especially useful for developers and testers to understand how the API works and experiment with it interactively.

Additionally, it can serve as a lightweight backoffice tool to manually manage API operations during maintenance.
